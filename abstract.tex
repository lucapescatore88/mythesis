\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
%
Flavour Changing Neutral Currents are transitions between different quarks with the same charge such as $\bquark\to\squark$ processes. These are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model but
can happen through loop diagrams, which causes the branching ratio of this type of decays
to be small, typically $\sim 10^{-6}$ or less. Particles beyond the SM can contribute in the loops enhancing
the branching fractions of these decays, which are therefore very sensitive new physics.
In this work two analysis of semileptonic $\bquark\to\squark\ll$ decays are presented.
First $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ decays are analysed to measure their branching fraction as a function
of the dimuon invariant mass, \qsq. Furthermore, an angular analysis of these decays is performed for the first time. 
Secondly, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ll$ decays are analysed measuring the ratio between the muon, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\mumu$, 
and electron, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ee$, channels, which is interesting as it is largely free
from uncertainties due to the knowledge of the hadronic matrix elements.
This thesis is organised in the following way. Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction} introduces the Standard Model and 
the concept of flavour and explains how rare decays can help us in the quest for physics beyond the SM.
Chapter~\ref{ch:detector} describes the LHCb detector, which was used to collect the data analysed in this thesis.
%This chapter also includes studies performed to validate the hadronic physics in LHCb simulation software.
Chapter~\ref{sec:Lmumu_intro} deals with the measurement of the differential branching fraction of the $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ 
decay, while Chapter~\ref{sec:ang_ana} describes an angular analysis of these decays.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:RKst_theory} reports the measurement of the $R_{\Kstarz}$ ratio between the decay rates
of the $\Bz\to\Kstarz\mumu$ and $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ee$ decays.

\chapter*{DECLARATION OF AUTHORS CONTRIBUTION}
%
I've done this and that bla bla...
%I am one of the main authors of the two analysis reported in Parts~\ref{par:Lmumu} and~\ref{par:RKst}
%of this thesis. For the analysis of the differential branching ratio of the $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ decay
%I collaborated with Michal Kreps, who took care of implementing the decay model to re-weight
%the simulation and provided a few of the simulated samples. Furthermore, I want to thank him
for the advice given throughout. The work in this part was also published and can be found at Ref.~\cite{Aaij:2015xza}.
%For the $R_{\Kstarz}$ analysis, described in Part~\ref{par:RKst}, I actively participated in all stages of the analysis collaborating with Simone Bifani. 

%Furthermore I'd like to thank Nigel Watson for the editorial advice and 
%the general support provided for both the analysis. 
%I must thank you the LHCb collaboration though which I obtained the data used in this work
%and that collectively participated to the analysis reviewing the work. I contributed to the collaboration
%in three ways. First of all, for two years, I have been ``Monte Carlo liaison", for the Rare Decays Working
%Group. This is a connection role between the physics analysis groups and the simulation team providing
%simulated samples vital for most analysis. In second place I have given my contribution to the LHCb
%simulation project, Gauss, by developing tools to validated the reliability of the simulation. Finally, I have
%taken several shifts in the control room during the Run II data taking in 2015, checking the smooth
%running of the detector.

\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
%
I thank everybody, evvvvvvvverybody!
%First of all I would like to thank Nigel, who always supported me in these years and
%granted be many good opportunities. I think I could not hope for a better supervisor.
%A big thank you also to Simone, with whom I collaborated for the $R_{\Kstarz}$ analysis
%and from who taught me a lot. Thanks also to the people of the Birmingham LHCb group:
%Cristina, Jimmy and also to Michal, who adopted us, Birmingham students, for a while.
%A special `thank you' goes to Pete, who shared with me this three years experience.
%I think it would have been a very different and less interesting experience without him.
%A `thank you' also goes to the members of the LHCb collaboration and in particular of the Rare
%Decays Working Group.; in particular to the working group conveners Gaia, Tom and Marco
%and to Gloria, who patiently guided me through the depts of the LHCb software.
%I want also to thank the LTA folks, who where with me during the long period I spent at CERN
%and especially Mark and Lewis, adventure companions. And speaking about CERN people
%a great `thank you' to Lorenzo, because when it's 1pm I always feel that I should be in front of the trays.
%Going now to who is always waiting for me in Italy when I go back, a big `thank you' to my
%family for all their support and all the italian food they brought me while I was living abroad.
%Thank you my dad Orazio, my mum Paola and my sisters Giulia and
%Silvia. A big `thank you' also to my friends Ivan, Enrico, Martina, Federico, Valentina, Letizia
%and all the others. And finally, last but not least, a giant thank you to Lucia, who is the engine
%of my life and to whom this thesis is dedicated.
