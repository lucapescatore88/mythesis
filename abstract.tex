\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
%
Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs) are transitions between different quarks with the same charge such as $\bquark\to\squark$ processes. These are forbidden at tree level in the Standard Model (SM) but
can happen through loop level electroweak diagrams, which causes the branching ratio of this type of decays
to be small, typically $\sim 10^{-6}$ or less. Particles beyond the SM can contribute in the loops enhancing
these the branching fractions of these decays, which are therefore very sensitive new physics.
In this work two analysis of semileptonic $\bquark\to\squark\ell\ell$ transitions are presented.
First al all $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ decays are analysed to measure their branching fraction as a function
of the dimuon invariant mass, \qsq. Furthermore an angular analysis of these decays is performed for the first time. Secondly, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ell\ell$ decays are analysed measuring the ratio between the muon, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\mumu$, and electron, $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ee$, channels, which is interesting as it is largely free
from uncertainties due to the knowledge of the hadronic matrix elements.
This thesis is organised in the following way. Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} introduces the Standard Model,
the concept of flavour and explains how rare decays can help us in the quest for beyond the SM physics.
Chapter~\ref{ch:detector} describes the LHCb detector which was used to collect the data analysed in this thesis. The rest is organised in two parts: Part~\ref{par:Lmumu} dealing with the analysis of $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ 
decays and Parts~\ref{par:RKst} describing the analysis of $\Bz\to\Kstarz\ell\ell$ decays.
Each of these two parts contains a brief theoretical introduction to the specific topic, a description of the
data samples used and a description of the analysis which follows in both parts the a series of steps.
First of all the selection process is described though which the interesting decay channels are isolated.
Secondly, after selection, the yield of interesting signal events is separated for the remaining background
fitting the invariant mass distributions of the selected events. In the third step the efficiency of the detector
is extracted in order to be able to correct the raw yields. Finally, the systematic uncertainties are studied and
the result determined.

\chapter*{DECLARATION OF AUTHORS CONTRIBUTION}
%
I was one of the main authors of the two analysis reported in Parts~\ref{par:Lmumu} and~\ref{par:RKst}
of this thesis. For the analysis of the differential branching ratio of the $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ decay
I collaborated with Michal Kreps, who took care of implementing the decay model to re-weight
the simulation and provided a few of the simulated samples. Furthermore, I want to thank him
for the advice given throughout. The work in this part was also published and can be found at Ref.~\cite{Aaij:2015xza}.
For the $R_{\Kstarz}$ analysis I actively participated in all stages of the analysis collaborating with Simone Bifani. Further more I'd like to thank Nigel Watson for the editorial advice and 
the general support provided for both the analysis. Furthermore I must thank you the LHCb collaboration
though which I obtained the data used in this work and that collectively participated to the analysis
reviewing the work. I contributed to the collaboration in three ways. First of all, for two years,
I have been "Monte Carlo liaison", for the Rare Decays Working Group. This is a connection role between the
physics analysis groups and the simulation team providing simulated samples vital for most analysis.
In second place I have given my contribution to the LHCb simulation project, Gauss, by developing tools
to validated the reliability of the simulation. Finally, I have taken several shifts in the control room during
the Run II data taking in 2015, checking the smooth running of the detector.

\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
%
First of all I would like to thank Nigel, who always supported me in these years and
granted be many good opportunities. I think I could not hope for a better supervisor.
A big thank you also to Simone, with whom I collaborated for the $R_{\Kstarz}$ analysis
and from whom I learnt a lot. Thanks also to the people of the Birmingham LHCb group
Cristina, Jimmy, Nat, Tim and also to Michal, who adopted us Birmingham students for a while.
And a special thank you to Pete, who shared with me this three years experiences.
I think it would have been a very different and less interesting experience without him.
A thank you also goes to the members of the LHCb collaboration and in particular of the Rare
Decays Working Group. A special thank you to the Working Group conveners Gaia, Tom and Marco
and to Gloria, who patiently guided me through the depts of the LHCb software.
I want also to thank the LTA folks, who where with me during the long period I spent at CERN
and in particular to Mark and Lewis, adventure companions. And speaking about CERN people
a great thank you to Lorenzo, because when it's 1pm I always fell I should be in front of the trays.
Going now to who is always waiting for me in Italy when I go back, a big thank you to my
family for all their support and all the italian food they brought me while I was living abroad.
Thank you my dad Orazio, my mum Paola and my sisters Giulia and
Silvia. A big thank you also to my friends Ivan, Enrico, Martina, Federico, Valentina, Letizia
and all the others. And finally, last but not least, a giant thank you to Lucia, who is the engine
of my life and to whom this thesis is dedicated.
