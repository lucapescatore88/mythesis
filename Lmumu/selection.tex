\chapter{Selection}
\label{sec:Lb_selection}

The reconstruction of $\Lb\to\Lz\mm$ and $\Lb\to\jpsi\Lz$ candidates begins with the application of
requirements on basic kinematic properties as \pt of the final particles and quality requirements
for the track and vertices from which the particles are derived.
This selection aims to first form a dimuon candidate from two oppositely changed muons. 
Then, in events containing a dimuon candidate, two oppositely charged tracks are combined
together and retained as \Lz candidate, if they form a good vertex which is well separated
from all primary vertices. In the final step, dimuon candidates are combined with \Lz candidates to form \Lb
baryons and requirements are set on the properties of this combination. 
The full list of cuts is reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:Lb_stripping}.

\end{table}

In the table \chisqip is defined as the projected distance from the vertex
divided by its uncertainty, for example \Bz $\chisqip(primary) > 4$ means
that the \Bz vertex is at least 2 standard deviations away from the primary vertex.
Another useful quantity to remove combinatorial background is a pointing variable
defined as the angle between the direction of the particle momentum and
the flight direction from its mother vertex, called DIRA.
Graphical representation of the \chisqip and DIRA variables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IPandDIRA}.
This allows the selection of particles with well-defined primary vertices.
The variable $\chi^2_{FD}$ represents the flight distance with respect to the origin vertex divided by its error. 
The $\chi^2_{trk}$/ndf and $\chi^2_{vtx}$/ndf quantities are the $\chi^2$ from the
fit to tracks and vertices, which are used to quantify their quality.
The {\verb GhostProb } quantity describes the probability of a track being fake.
By construction, cutting at 0.4, removes $(1 - 0.4)\cdot 100 = 60\%$ of fake tracks.
The {\verb hasRich }, {\verb hasCalo } and {\verb isMuon } variables are binary indicators that
the information from the RICH/calorimeter/muon detector is available for the track.
Loose Particle Identification (PID) cuts are also applied in pre-selection to limit the size of the samples.
Details about the quantification of the PID quality are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:PID_perf}.
%To quantify the probability of particular particle identity a combined likelihood is calculated
%combining information from the calorimeters, the RICH and the Muon detectors.
%The pion hypothesis is used as a reference point and the probability of a specific ID is given
%in terms of the difference between the Log-Likelihood of the given hypothesis and the pion.
%This variable is called is called Delta Log-Likelihood (DLL) and denoted with \verb!PID!.
%For example:
%\begin{equation}
%\verb!PID!_K = \text{DLL}_{K-\pi} = \log(\mathcal{L}_K) - \log(\mathcal{L}_\pi)
%\end{equation}
%quantifies the probability of a particle being a kaon rather than a pion.
%For details about the definition of the variables used see Ref. \cite{Loki_twiki}.
A large mass window is kept around the \Lb peak in order to be able
to fit the sideband, to train the multivariate analysis and better constrain backgrounds.
Rare candidates are simply selected by the \qsq region requirements as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Lb_q2choice}
while resonant candidates are further constrained to have dimuon invariant mass
in a 100 \mevcc interval around the known \jpsi mass.

\section{Neural Networks}
\label{sec:Lb_mva}

The final selection is performed using neural network (NN) based on NeuroBayes package~\cite{Feindt:2006pm,feindt-2004}.
The input to the neural network consists of 14 variables carrying information about the kinematics of the decay,
the quality of tracks and vertices and the PID of the muons.
The list of inputs to the neural network is in Tab.~\ref{tab:Lb_nnInputs}. Together with it we give
ranking and information on the importance of inputs.
%
%In appendix \ref{app:MC_data_comp} we report comparisons between the variable used in data and Monte Carlo.
%On data we extract the signal distribution using the sideband subtraction technique.
%
%Under ``adds" is shown how much discriminating power a variable adds with respect to the previous ones.
%Under ``only this" is shown how much power each single input has independently of all others. Under ``loss" 
%is provided information about how much power is lost if each single input is removed.
%
Variables related to \Lz and its daughters are considered as different inputs depending on the
candidate type (long or downstream). This effectively corresponds to making a separate
training for the two categories. Further details on the definition and calculation of the
variables importance is available in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2011-094}.
The graphical representation of the correlation matrix is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lb_nnCorrelation},
where the variable with $ID = 1$ is the NN output and the IDs of the other variables can be found
in Tab.~\ref{tab:Lb_nnInputs}.

The single most important variable used for downstream candidates is the transverse momentum of
\Lz, which allows to reject random combination of tracks as these have preferentially low \pt.
For long candidates instead the best variable is the $\chi^2$ from a kinematic fit that constrains
the decay products of the \Lb, the \Lz and the dimuon, to originate from their respective vertices
performed using the \verb!DecayTreeFitter! tool (see Sec.~\ref{sec:DTF}).
Other variables that contribute significantly are the \chisqip of \Lb, \Lz and muons,
the separation between \Lb and \Lz vertices and finally the muon PID.

The NN is trained using representative samples for signal and background. 
For the signal a sample of simulated \Lb\to\Lz\mm events is used. For the background a representative sample
is given by candidates in the upper $m(K\pi\mu\mu)$ invariant mass sideband. Only the upper sideband,
$m_{K\pi\mu\mu} > 6 \gevcc$, is used since it contains only combinatorial background,
while the lower sideband may contain partially reconstructed and misreconstructed candidates.
In the background samples are still present \jpsi and \psitwos peaks indicating that charmonium resonances
can be combined with other random tracks. These candidates do not give a good description of purely
combinatorial background and, in order to avoid biases, they are removed from the background training
sample by rejecting events in a 100 \mevcc  interval around the nominal \jpsi and \psitwos masses~\cite{PDG2014}.
%The events above $6 \gevcc$ used for training are not used in the subsequent analysis. 
For the signal the training is performed combining simulated $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ events corresponding 
to the beam conditions in both years. %Only triggered events are used for training.
A total of 30000 total events is used for the training. This corresponds $\sim 50\%$ of the available
sideband data sample and $\sim 20\%$ of the simulated sample. The full simulated sample is not used
as it will also be used to study efficiencies. Events are uniformly samples over full simulated sample.

and purity ($P=N(\mathrm{signal})/N(\mathrm{background})$) as a function of the neural network output.
On this plot the distributions from test samples are also overlaid in order to check for overtraining. 
The distributions follow the same shape but with different fluctuations
indicating no significant overtraining. In general the neural network
is able to separate signal from background and the training converged properly.

It can happen that too much information is given to the classifier, which becomes able to 
calculate the invariant mass of the candidates from the input variables.
This can generate fake peaks and it is therefore important to check
for correlations between the 4-body invariant mass and the NN output.
Figure~\ref{fig:Lb_NNprofiles} reports the average NN output value as a function of
4-body $m(K\pi\mu\mu)$ invariant mass for data and simulation. The distributions
are flat indicating that no significant correlation is present.

%As side note, we do not imply any particle identification on the \Lz daughters, nor we explicitly
%veto contributions where \KS is misreconstructed as \Lz. As will be seen later, \Bz decays
%containing \KS do not pose significant issues and any sensible attempt to significantly suppress
%them would result in significant loss of the statistics.




\section{MVA optimization}
\label{sec:Lb_mva_opt}

In the high \qsq region, where the signal is already observed, the final requirement on the neural network output
is chosen in order to maximise the significance, $N_{\mathrm{S}}/\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{S}}+N_{\mathrm{B}}}$, where
$N_\mathrm{S}$ is number of expected signal candidates and $N_\mathrm{B}$ the number of expected background candidates.
$N_\mathrm{S}$ is derived from simulation but, as an arbitrary number of events can be generated, it
needs to be normalised. To do this, the invariant mass distribution of real $\Lb\to\jpsi\Lz$ candidates
is fit after preselection (including all requirements but MVA). This is possible as the peak of the resonant
channel is already well visible after preselection. Then the resonant yield is scaled by the ratio
of between the $\Lb\to\Lz\mumu$ and $\Lb\to\jpsi\Lz$ branching fractions as measured 
by LHCb on 2011 data 
\begin{equation}
\BR(\Lb\to\Lz\mumu) / \BR(\Lb\to\jpsi\Lz) =  1.54 \times 10^{-3}
\end{equation}
\noindent
and $\jpsi\to\mumu$ branching fraction. In summary
\begin{equation}
N_\mathrm{S} = N_\jpsi \cdot \frac{\BR(\Lb\to\Lz\mumu)}{\BR(\Lb\to\jpsi\Lz) \cdot \BR(\jpsi\to\mumu) }.
\end{equation}
%
The number of expected backgrund events instead is derived fitting the data
sideband with an exponential and extrapolating under the singnal region.

In the low \qsq region, where the signal is unobserved, the so called ``Punzi figure of merit",
$N_{\mathrm{S}}/(n_\sigma/2+\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{B}}})$, is maximised \cite{Punzi:2003bu}.
This figure-of-merit is considered to be optimal for discovery and the parameter with $n_\sigma$ corresponds to
the number of expected standard deviations of significance, in this analysis $n_\sigma = 3$ is used.
Moreover the Punzi shape does not depend on the relative normalisation between signal and background, which
is important since the signal is still unobserved at low \qsq and existing predictions vary significantly
for this region. The dependence of the figure-of-merit for both \qsq regions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lb_FOM}, and curves
of signal efficiency versus background rejection are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lb_ROC}.

For final selection the neural network output is required to be larger than 0.81 for high \qsq region
and 0.96 for the low \qsq one. Using these requirements the neural network retains approximately 96\% (66 \%)
of downstream candidates and 97 \% (82 \%) of long candidates for the selection at high (low) q2, with respect to
the preselected event sample. After the full selection $\sim 0.5$\% of the events contain multiple candidates
which are randomly rejected to keep only one candidate per event. 
%
%As reminder, in low \qsq region we start with much larger background than in high \qsq region.
%Moreover, while background rejection looks similar at selected requirement, in terms of amount of background kept, there is huge difference. 
%
To normalise the branching ratio measurement \jpsi events are selected using the low and high \qsq selection to normalise
respectively low and high \qsq intervals.

\section{Trigger}

In addition specific trigger lines are selected, corresponding to events triggered by the muons
of the reconstructed candidate. This is denoted as Trigger On Signal (TOS).
The trigger lines used in the analysis are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:Lb_triggerLines}.
The logical {\em or } of lines on the same lever is required and the logical {\em and }
and lined in different levels.
%

\caption{Summary of trigger lines which candidates have to pass at various trigger levels.
Trigger is always required to be due to tracks of the candidate itself.}

Trigger Level &  Lines   \\ \hline

                & L0DiMuon \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:Lb_triggerLines}
\end{table}
%
The L0Muon trigger requires hits in the muon detector and triggers if a muon with $\pt > 1.5 \gevc$ is identified.
L0Dimuon imposes the same requirement on the sum of the transverse momenta of two tracks.
The Hlt1TrackAllL0 performs a partial reconstruction of the events and applied basic requirements on the
IP, $\chi^2$ and transverse momentum of tracks and triggers if the L0 decision is confirmed. Hlt1TrackMuon applies looser requirements 
but in addition requires the \verb!isMuon! variable (see Sec.~\ref{sec:PID_perf}) to be true to limit the yield.
Finally, at the Hlt2 level, a complete reconstruction is done and a multivariate analysis is used to identify decay structures. One of the main variables used at this stage is the distance of closest approach (DOCA), which is 
required to be less than 0.2 mm to form a 2-body object.

\section{Background from specific decays}

A survey of possible peaking backgrounds concluded that the only physics background
to take into account is coming from misreconstructed decays of \Bz to \KS with
two muons, whether via \jpsi or not. The lack of background from other decays is
mainly due to the particular topology of the \Lz decay which has a displaces vertex.
In order to study the effect of misreconstructed $\Bz\ra\jpsi\KS$ and $\Bz\ra\KS\mumu$ decays
simulated samples are used, where the \KS is reconstructed as a \Lz with a $p\rightarrow \pi$ identity
swap and $m(p\pi)$ in the \Lz mass window.
On data the $\Bz\ra\jpsi\KS$ contribution is clearly visible in the resonant channel mass distribution.
This background is not suppressed with specific cuts in this analysis as its mass shape is sufficiently distinct
the from \Lb signal, which allows to reliably model its contribution in the mass fits (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Lb_fit}).
For rare case a rough estimate of the size is made using the yield in the resonant channel
rescaled the measured ratios between the rare and resonant branching ratios.
Details are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:Lb_fit} and numbers of events predicted are reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:KSprediction}.
This contribution, although close to negligible is again considered in the fit.
A possible pollution due to $B^{+} \ra\mumu K^{*+}$ decays, where the $K^{*+}$
further decays into $\KS\pi$ is also investigated using a dedicated Monte Carlo sample and found to be negligible.
Finally, \Lb\ra\jpsi\Lz events radiating photons from the final state, can escape the \jpsi veto
and be reconstructed in the rare channel. Analysing simulated events it was found that the only
contribution is in the closest \qsq interval to the \jpsi tail, $6 < \qsq < 8$ \gevgevcccc.
In this interval 1.3\% of the \Lb\to\jpsi\Lz candidates are reconstructed but only 0.06\%
falls into the 4-body invariant mass window used for the fits. This corresponds to $\sim 6$
events, 4 of which in the downstream category. Given the low yield and that these events do
not peak under the signal but show a decaying distribution in the fit mass window this
background is considered as absorbed in the combinatorial background.
%Given that this contribution does not contribute in the region where we expect \Lb peak, we do
%not attempt to exclude this but it is again modelled in the fit.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:peakingBkgs} is reported the invariant mass distribution of simulated $\Lb\ra\jpsi\Lz$
events falling into the rare \qsq region.
